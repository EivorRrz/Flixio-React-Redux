# Flixio

Flixio is my personal project to flex my React & Redux skills. It's a slick, scalable web app for movie lovers, packed with features to explore, search, and get detailed movie info – all powered by a dynamic backend!

## Features

- **Reusable React Components**: Clean, modular code.
- **Redux**: Keepin' state under control.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on every device (or we cry).
- **Dynamic Content**: Always up-to-date movie data.
- **Search Functionality**: Find your next binge-worthy show.
- **Detailed Info**: Get the 411 on every movie/show.
